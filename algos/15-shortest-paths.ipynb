    "# 15. Single-Source Shortest Paths Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Will be exploring graphs with weights on their edges\n",
    "    - Graphs are G(V, E, W)\n",
    "        - V = vertices\n",
    "        - E = edges\n",
    "        - W = weights\n",
    "- Algorithms:\n",
    "    - Djikstra's Algorithm --> complexity is O(V * log(V) + E) essentially linear\n",
    "        - only works on positive weight edges\n",
    "        - E is at most V^2 or O(V^2)\n",
    "    - Bellman-Ford Algorithm --> complexity is O(VE)\n",
    "        - works on positive and negative weight edges\n",
    "        - complexity is worse than Djikstra's\n",
    "        - this needs to find cycles of negative weights which needs more work\n",
    "    - Note that the complexities are independent of W (weight)\n",
    "- Definitions:\n",
    "    - path p = <v0, v1, ..., vk>\n",
    "        - is path if (vi, vi+1) in E for 0 <= i < k \n",
    "    - Weight(path) = summation of weight of edges\n",
    "    - Goal: find path p with minimum weight\n",
    "    - Note: potentially exponential number of paths\n",
    "        - algorithms will need to work around this cleverly\n",
    "- Weighted graphs:\n",
    "    - v0 -P-> vk\n",
    "        - (v0) is a path from v0 to v0 of weight 0\n",
    "    - shortest path weight from u to v as\n",
    "        - S(u, v) where S is delta\n",
    "            - either the minimum of weighted paths from u to v\n",
    "            - or if no such path exists, denote the shortest path by infinity\n",
    "- Things we need:\n",
    "    - d(v): current weight of path at a vertex\n",
    "        - whe d(v) becomes S, we found the best path\n",
    "    - PI(v): predecesor vertex on the best path of v\n",
    "        - PI(s) = None (the starting point)\n",
    "- Negative weights:\n",
    "    - why? examples:\n",
    "        - paths that might lead to gain or loss in money\n",
    "        - monopoly\n",
    "        - social networks (likes, dislikes)\n",
    "    - we can also think if there's a way to shift all weights such that we only deal with positive weights so that we can use Djikstra instead of BF\n",
    "- Negative cycles:\n",
    "    - may lead to infinite  --> PROBLEM\n",
    "    - BF needs to give delta numbers for vertices that have finite numbers and then mark all other vertices with -inf\n",
    "    - BF also needs to be able to detect negative cycles\n",
    "- General structure of shortest path algorithms for no-negative cycles:\n",
    "    - Initialize for v in V\n",
    "        - d[v] = inf\n",
    "        - PI[v] = None\n",
    "        - d[s] = 0 --> source\n",
    "    - Repeat\n",
    "        - select edge (u, v) [somehow]\n",
    "        - \"Relax\" edge (u, v) --> look at it, examine, and do things\n",
    "            - if d[v] > d[u] + w(u, v)\n",
    "                - do d[v] = d[u] + w(u, v)\n",
    "                - do PI[v] = u\n",
    "        - repeat until all edges have d[v] <= d[u] + w(u, v)\n",
    "            - we want to reach the point where no edges can be relaxed\n",
    "- Optimal substructure property:\n",
    "    - Subpaths of a shortest path are shortest paths\n",
    "    - see notes for triangle inequality"
