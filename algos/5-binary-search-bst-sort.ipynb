    "- Runway Reservation Problem:\n",
    "    - Airport with a single, busy runway\n",
    "    - We need a data structure (a set) that will allow us to keep track of airplane landings. Data structure contains times (let the times be a monotonically increasing function for simplicity)\n",
    "    - When the plane lands, we remove it from the set of pending landings\n",
    "    - When a landing request comes in, place the time of request in the data structure ONLY IF no other landings are scheduled within k minutes (let k be a variable you'd put into the insert function but for the example consider k = 3)\n",
    "    - Operations needed:\n",
    "        - insert()\n",
    "        - remove()\n",
    "    - SPECIFICATION: All operations need to be done in O(log(n)) time\n",
    "- Problems with Different Data Structures for the RRP?\n",
    "    - Unsorted array:\n",
    "        - the k minute check would take _O(n)_ which is > _O(log(n))_\n",
    "    - Sorted array:\n",
    "        - could do binary search to find where to insert a time --> would take _O(log(n))_ time to find insertion point\n",
    "        - the k minute check would take _O(1)_ time\n",
    "        - BUT the insertion would need to shift all elements to the right one over which would take _O(n)_ time\n",
    "    - Sorted list (linked list):\n",
    "        - can insert in _O(1)_ time by moving pointers\n",
    "        - BUT can't do binary search on a list\n",
    "    - Heaps\n",
    "        - min/max heap has WEAK invariant in terms of children as opposed to left and right subtrees as is the case with binary search tree\n",
    "        - if you want to find where to put a new time, t into the data structure (we would need to find an element that is <= k or >= k from t), it would take _O(n)_ time.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree:**\n",
    "    - Data structure needs:\n",
    "        - node x\n",
    "            - each node has a key which can be returned through key(x)\n",
    "        - pointers\n",
    "            - parent(x) --> parent of a node\n",
    "            - left(x) --> left child\n",
    "            - right(x) --> right child\n",
    "    - INVARIANT:\n",
    "        - for all nodes x\n",
    "            - if y is in the left subtree of x, key(y) <= key(x)\n",
    "            - if y is in the right subtree of x, key(y) >= key(x)\n",
    "    - Some operations:\n",
    "        - find_min() --> keep going to the left until you hit a leaf and return the key of the leaf. \n",
    "        - find_max() --> keep going to the right until you hit a leaf and the return the key of the leaf\n",
    "        - next_larger() --> return the key of the node to the right\n",
    "    - BSTs are augmentable --> can alter to fit into problem specifications\n",
    "    - BSTs and RRP:\n",
    "        - before inserting an element, t, in the BST, we would run a check at the node we are inserting at, parent(t), is within k minutes of t.\n",
    "            - IF IT IS, we can insert, ELSE, can not insert\n",
    "        - the insertion with the check operation would take _O(h)_ time where h is the height of the tree\n",
    "            - WHY h and not log(n)?\n",
    "                - need balanced trees in order for it be O(log(n))\n",
    "                - h could very well be n which is a problem\n",
    "        - NOW, let's say the problem statement changed and we now want this extra feature Rank(t)\n",
    "            - Rank(t) --> returns # of planes that are scheduled to land at times <= t\n",
    "            - We augment BST structure so that each keeps track of the number of sub-nodes under it + itself\n",
    "                - <img src = \"screenshots/img_4.png\" width = 400>\n",
    "                - as a result, adding an element would change the numbers associated with each node\n",
    "            - To do Rank(t) we would follow the procedure detailed in the above picture.\n",
    "                - It would take _O(h)_ time\n",
    "            - Rank(t) example: --> Rank(79) in the above\n",
    "                - @ 49 --> add 1 AND add 2 (from the 46 subtree)\n",
    "                - @ 79 --> add 1, 79 <= 79 AND subtree-size to the left (subtree 64)"
