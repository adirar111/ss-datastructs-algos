    "# 19. Dynamic Programming I: Fibonacci, Shortest Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motivation: desigining new algorithms\n",
    "- Dynamic programming (DP) is a general and powerful algorithm design technique\n",
    "    - \"careful brute force\"\n",
    "- Examples explained using fibonacci and shortest paths problem\n",
    "- DP - Memoization:\n",
    "    - memoize (remember):\n",
    "        - remember and reuse solutions to subproblems that help solve the problem.\n",
    "    - time = # subproblems * (time per subproblem)\n",
    "    - subproblem dependencies should be acyclic\n",
    "        - to make cyclic acyclic:\n",
    "            - make multiple layers/ copies of the graph, reduce it to k copies.\n",
    "            - every edge takes you down to the next layer\n",
    "            - <img src=\"screenshots/img_6.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    "- DP - Bottom-up DP:\n",
    "    - does exactly the same computation as computation\n",
    "    - topological sort of subproblem dependency DAG\n",
    "        - topological sort is usually just a for loop\n",
    "        - need to move in order to compute what you want\n",
    "    - can often save space"
