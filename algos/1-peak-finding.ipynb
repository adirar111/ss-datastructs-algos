    "# 1. Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding\n",
    "- **Problem: Find a peak in an array (if it exists).**\n",
    "    - For ease of understanding, henceforth, O will be used to refer to Θ notation.\n",
    "- In a 1D array of numbers, a position is a peak if and only if the number at that position is >= the numbers before and after it in the array.  \n",
    "    - At the edges, you'll only need to look at the element to the right (for the first) or left (for the last) of the edge.  \n",
    "- **Straightforward algorithm:**\n",
    "    - Traverse array from beginning to end\n",
    "    - Complexity is Θ(n)\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer algorithm:**\n",
    "    - In array of n positions, look at n/2 position\n",
    "        - if a[n/2] < a[n/2 -1] then only look at the left half of the array (positions 1 -> n/2 -1 to find a peak)\n",
    "        - else if a[n/2] < a[n/2 + 1] then only look at the right half of the array (positions n/2 + 1 -> n to find a peak)\n",
    "        - else n/2 is a peak\n",
    "    - Complexity is Θ(log<sub>2</sub>n)\n",
    "        - T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)\n",
    "        - base case is Θ(1) --> in the case of a 1 element array\n",
    "- Comparing these 2 algorithms:\n",
    "    - divide and conquer algorithm is significantly faster than the straightforward one.\n",
    "- In a 2D array of numbers, a position is a peak if and only if the number at teh position is >= the numbers above, below, to the left, and right of it.\n",
    "    - For the purposes of discussion, n = number of rows, m = number of columns\n",
    "- **Greedy Ascent \"Algorithm\" - 2D:**\n",
    "    - Picks a direction and tries to follow a direction in order to find a peak.\n",
    "    - Has to make choice as to where to start and move\n",
    "    - Complexity is Θ(nm) or if n = m, Θ(n^2)\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer algorithm (incorrect) - 2D**:\n",
    "    - Pick middle column j = m/2\n",
    "    - Find a 1D peak at in the j column at some position in the 2D array (i, j)\n",
    "    - Use row (i) as a start to find a 1D peak on row (i)\n",
    "    - This would be efficient (Θ(log<sub>2</sub>n) or Θ(log<sub>2</sub>m)) but it DOESN'T work.\n",
    "        - Once you try and find a peak on row i, you may no longer have a peak at that column anymore. A 2D peak is not guaranteed.   \n",
    "- **Divide and conquer algorithm (correct)**:\n",
    "    - Pick a middle column j = m/2\n",
    "    - Find global maximum on column j at some position (i, j)\n",
    "    - Compare (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)\n",
    "    - Pick left columns if (i, j-1) > (i, j) OR pick right columns if (i, j) > (i, j + 1)\n",
    "        - This decreases the number of columns to deal with (half)\n",
    "        - Solve the problem with half the number of columns\n",
    "    - In the case that (i, j) >= (i, j-1) and (i, j) >= (i, j+1) --> (i, j) is a peak.\n",
    "    - In the case of a single column, find the global maximum, and you're done.\n",
    "    - Complexity is Θ(nlog<sub>2</sub>m)\n",
    "        - T(n, m) = T(n, m/2) + Θ(n) where Θ(n) is the work to find the global maximum\n",
    "        - Base case: T(n,1) = Θ(n)\n",
    "- Note: all of these algorithms (written out below) are recursive."
