    "# 9. Table Doubling, Karp-Rabin\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do we choose m?\n",
    "    - When making a table, we need to make a table of size m. How do we know what to make m?\n",
    "    - We want m = O(n) or proportional to n (theta)\n",
    "        - we know alpha = O(1) (theta)\n",
    "    - IDEA:\n",
    "        - start small: m = 8 (some constant)\n",
    "        - grows/shrinks as necessary\n",
    "        - Let's say we insert 8 items and try inserting a 9th\n",
    "        - If n > m: grow the table\n",
    "    - Grow table: means that m --> m'\n",
    "        - to do this we need to\n",
    "            - make table of size m'\n",
    "            - build new hash function h'\n",
    "                - because the table has changed size\n",
    "            - rehash:\n",
    "                - for item in T:\n",
    "                    - T'.insert(item) # in new table\n",
    "            - this takes O(n + m + m') but is basically O(n)\n",
    "        - m' = 2m --> **TABLE DOUBLING**\n",
    "            - cost of n inserts:\n",
    "                - O(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + n)\n",
    "                - = O(n)\n",
    "        - IDEA of AMORTIZATION:\n",
    "            - operation takes \"T(n) amortized\" if k operations take <= k * T(n) time (at most k * T(n))\n",
    "            - think of this as meaning \"T(n) on average\" where the average is over all operations\n",
    "            - only relevant to data structures\n",
    "        - IDEA: **Table Doubling**\n",
    "            - for k inserts take O(k) time\n",
    "                - O(1) amortized for insert\n",
    "            - Also the same for k inserts and deletes they take O(k) time\n",
    "        - Problem: if we do n inserts then n deletes but m = maximum value of n over time\n",
    "            - Fix deletion:\n",
    "                - 1. if m = n/2 then shrink to m/2\n",
    "                    - ISSUE: this is slow if we go from 2^k <-> 2^k + 1 we get O(n) per operation\n",
    "                - 2. if m = n/4 then shrink to m/2\n",
    "                    - this works and the amortized time becomes O(1) constant\n",
    "- Python list implementation\n",
    "    - list.append and list.pop are O(1) time amortized\n",
    "- String matching\n",
    "    - given 2 strings s and t: does s occur as a substring of t?\n",
    "    - simple algorithm --> O(|s| * |t|) in notes\n",
    "- Rolling hash ADT:\n",
    "    - given hash value r, we want to do r.append(c)\n",
    "        - this adds character c to the end of x\n",
    "        - r maintains a string x\n",
    "    - we also want to delete the first character of x r.skip(first_char)\n",
    "    - r() will give us the hash value of x = h(x)\n",
    "- Karp-Rabin algorithm:\n",
    "    - compute the hash function of search string s\n",
    "        - note: rolling hash data structure only allows us to add characters\n",
    "        - let our hash is rs\n",
    "    - compute the hash function of the first s characters of our string t\n",
    "        - let our hash be rt\n",
    "    - check if the 2 hashes rs and rt are equal\n",
    "        - just because the hashes are equal, doesn't mean the strings are equal.\n",
    "        - we need to check whether or not s == the substring by iterating over s\n",
    "        - if equal, we are done\n",
    "        - else: we want to enginneer this so that this occurs at a low probability\n",
    "    - iterate over len(s), len(t)\n",
    "        - skip over the first letter\n",
    "        - add one more additional letter\n",
    "        - if rs and rt are equal\n",
    "            - we need to check whether or not s == the substring by iterating over s\n",
    "            - if equal, we are done\n",
    "            - else: we want to enginneer this so that this occurs at a low probability\n",
    "    - complexity: O(|s| + |t| + (# of matches) * |s|) which is linear O(1) if we care about a single match"
