    "# 10. Open Addressing, Cryptographic Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open addressing\n",
    "    - another way to implement a hash table other than hashing with chaining\n",
    "    - no chianing, no pointers\n",
    "    - way to implement hash tables using arrays\n",
    "    - way it works:\n",
    "        - 1 item per slot\n",
    "        - m >= n\n",
    "            - m = slots\n",
    "            - n = elements\n",
    "    - IDEA: Probing\n",
    "        - we need a hash function that specifies order of slots to probe (try) for  a key (for insert/ search/ delete)\n",
    "        - h: U x {0, 1, ..., m - 1} --> {0, 1, ..., m - 1}\n",
    "            - U = universe of keys\n",
    "            - {0, 1, ..., m - 1} = trial count (as argument)\n",
    "                - you will go through different trial to get a valid position\n",
    "            - {0, 1, ..., m - 1} = slot number (as result)\n",
    "    - We want all slot to be able to get filled out\n",
    "        - want h(k, 1), h(k, 2), ... h(k, m-1) to be permutations of 0, 1, ... m-1\n",
    "    - Methods:\n",
    "        - insert(k, v)\n",
    "            - keep probing until an empty slot is found. insert item when empty is found.\n",
    "                - insert treats DeleteMe the same as None\n",
    "        - search(k)\n",
    "            - as long as the slots encountered are occupied by keys != k, keep probing until you either encounter k or find an empty slot\n",
    "                - sucess means finding k \n",
    "                - encountering a DeleteMe flag, search continues\n",
    "                - failure means finding empty or not finding it at all\n",
    "        - delete(k)\n",
    "            - replaced delete item with DeleteMe flag (a different flag than None\n",
    "    - Probing strategies/ modifying hash functions:\n",
    "        - Linear probing: h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i) mod m\n",
    "            - clarification:\n",
    "                - h' is a regular hash function\n",
    "                - mod m satisfies the permutation\n",
    "            - PROBLEM: clusters\n",
    "                - clustering is consecutive groups of occupied slots which keep growing (they get longer and longer)\n",
    "        - Double hashing: h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i * h2(k)) mod m\n",
    "            - if h2(k) is relatively prime to m --> we get the permutations we want\n",
    "                - m = 2^r, h2(k) for all k is odd\n",
    "    - Uniform Hashing Assumption (!= simple uniform hashing)\n",
    "        - each key is equally likely to have any one of the m! permutations as its probe sequence\n",
    "            - with this we can prove that the cost of operations for insert, search, delete is <= 1/(1-alpha)\n",
    "                - alpha = n/m"
