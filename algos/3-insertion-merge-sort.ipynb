    "# 3. Insertion Sort, Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why sorting?\n",
    "    - Typical applications of sorting (phone book)\n",
    "    - Makes solving other problems easier\n",
    "        - Median\n",
    "        - Binary search --> paradigm of divide and conquer\n",
    "            - look only at a particular half of a data set depending on what you're looking for\n",
    "        - Compression\n",
    "        - Rendering computer graphics\n",
    "- **Insertion Sort**\n",
    "    - Pseudocode:\n",
    "        - For i = 1, 2, ... n --> start at index 1 because by definition, the element at i = 0 is already sorted\n",
    "            - insert A[i] in the right position into *sorted (assumption)* array A[0 : i-1] (these are all elements to the left of A[i])\n",
    "            - done by pairwise swaps down to the correct position that is initially in A[i]\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - [5 2 4 6 1 3]\n",
    "        - start with second element called \"key\", 2. We must perform a swap\n",
    "        - [2 5 4 6 1 3] looking at 4, we must swap\n",
    "        - [2 4 5 6 1 3] looking at 6, no swap required, new key = 1\n",
    "        - [2 4 5 6 1 3] looking at 1, we must swap 1 repeatedly (4 swaps)\n",
    "        - [1 2 4 5 6 3] looking at 3, we must swap 3 repeatedly (3 swaps)\n",
    "        - [1 2 3 4 5 6] final sorted\n",
    "    - Analysis:\n",
    "        - O(n) steps (key movements) for any key position\n",
    "        - Each step is O(n) swaps OR compares and swaps\n",
    "        - **Complexity** *= O(n^2) where n is the size of the array*\n",
    "            - O(n^2) compares and O(n^2) swaps\n",
    "        - Assuming that a compare and a swap are equal in cost (when dealing with numbers)\n",
    "            - Note that if you're sorting objects (ex. records) and use a different function for comparing, this assumption fails. Compares may be more expensive than swaps\n",
    "            - Let's consider that compares ARE more expensive than swaps\n",
    "                - can be made more efficient by using *binary search* instead of pairwise swaps\n",
    "                - the compare part of insertion sort would O(nlog(n))\n",
    "                - but the swap part would still O(n^2) for swaps\n",
    "                - O(n^2) > O(nlog(n)) so the complexity is still O(n^2)\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** --> Recursive divide and conquer\n",
    "    - Take an array A and split it into L and R (both are size n/2)\n",
    "        - L --> L' (sorted as a result of merging) (size n/2)\n",
    "        - R --> R' (sorted as a result of merging) (size n/2)\n",
    "        - end up with a sorted array A' as a result of merging L' and R'\n",
    "    - **Merge** is the key subroutine\n",
    "    - Invariant for **merge** routine: two sorted array as input\n",
    "        - Example:\n",
    "            - L' = 20 13 7 2\n",
    "            - R' = 12 11 9 1\n",
    "            - look at 1 and 2, 1 is smaller so we put 1 down --> [1]\n",
    "            - look at 9 and 2, 2 is smaller so we put 2 down --> [1 2]\n",
    "            - look at 9 and 7, 7 is smaller so we put 7 down --> [1 2 7]\n",
    "            - look at 9 and 13, 9 is smaller so we put 9 down --> [1 2 7 9]\n",
    "            - look at 11 and 13, 11 is smaller --> [1 2 7 9 11]\n",
    "            - look at 12 and 13, 12 is smaller --> [1 2 7 9 11 12]\n",
    "            - look at 20 and 13, 13 is smaller --> [1 2 7 9 11 12 13]\n",
    "            - last element is 20 --> [1 2 7 9 11 12 13 20]\n",
    "        - All of the work is in the **merge** routine\n",
    "    - Analysis:\n",
    "        - Merge step has complexity that is O(n)\n",
    "            - takes two arrays of size n/2 and must do the merge subroutine on them\n",
    "        - **Complexity** *= O(nlog(n))* \n",
    "        - T(n) = c + 2 * T(n/2)) + c * n\n",
    "            - c = constant for dividing\n",
    "            - 2 * T(n/2) for recursion\n",
    "            - c * n for merge\n",
    "        - Expansion of c * n merge subroutine to explain O(nlog(n)) complexity\n",
    "            - ![image](screenshots/img_1.png)\n",
    "            - 1 + log(n) levels and n leaves\n",
    "                - each leaf is a single element and by definition is already sorted\n",
    "                - each level takes c * n time\n",
    "                - c and O(...) are basically the same for our purposes\n",
    "                - The recurrence becomes T(n) = (1 + log(n)) * cn\n",
    "                    - T(n) = (c * n) * (1 + log(n)) --> work * levels\n",
    "                    - T(n) = O(nlog(n))\n",
    "- Advantage of insertion sort over merge sort\n",
    "    - Merge sort needs O(n) extra/ auxillary space\n",
    "    - In-place sorting in insertion sort needs O(1) extra/auxillary space\n",
    "    - Simply, insertion sort is better on *memory* for large data sets\n",
    "    - Can manipulate merge sort to be more space efficient\n",
    "        - in-place merge sort exists --> a paper was written\n",
    "- **Merge sort in Python**\n",
    "    - Takes 2.2nlog(n) microseconds\n",
    "- **Insertion sort in Python**\n",
    "    - Takes 0.2n^2 microseconds\n",
    "    - For comparison, C takes 0.01n^2 microseconds because it's compiled not interpreted\n",
