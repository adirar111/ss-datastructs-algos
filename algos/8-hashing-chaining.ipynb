    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary - ADT**\n",
    "    - maintains a set of items each with a key\n",
    "    - operations:\n",
    "        - insert(item) --> overwrites any existing key\n",
    "        - delete(item)\n",
    "        - search(key): returns item with given key or report error if DNE\n",
    "    - operations take O(log(n)) via AVL\n",
    "    - but how do we do search in O(1)\n",
    "    - Python Dictionaries:\n",
    "        - D[key] --> search\n",
    "        - D[key] = val --> insert\n",
    "        - del D[key] --> delete\n",
    "        - item = (key, value)\n",
    "    - Motivations:\n",
    "        - document distance\n",
    "        - databases\n",
    "        - compilers and interpreters\n",
    "        - network router and server\n",
    "        - ----------- more subtle -----------\n",
    "        - substring\n",
    "        - string commonalities\n",
    "- How do dictionaries work:\n",
    "    - Simple approach:\n",
    "        - direct-access table \n",
    "        - store items in array indexed by key\n",
    "        - PROBLEMS:\n",
    "            - 1. keys may not be integers\n",
    "            - 2. hogs memory\n",
    "        - SOLUTIONS:\n",
    "            - 1. prehashing (in python called hash BUT NOT HASHING)\n",
    "                - maps keys to non-negative integers \n",
    "                - in theory, keys are finite and discrete strings of bits\n",
    "                - in PYTHON:\n",
    "                    - hash(x) --> maps x to string of numbers\n",
    "                    - some issues hash(x) could equal hash(y) even though x == y\n",
    "                    - ideally two hashes should be the same iff x == y\n",
    "                - you don't want the prehashes of your keys to ever change otherwise you run into problems when searching\n",
    "            - 2. hashing\n",
    "                - \"to cut into pieces and mix around\"\n",
    "                - reduce universe U of all keys to a reasonable size _m_ for table\n",
    "                - idea: m = O(n)\n",
    "                    - size of table proportional to # of keys in dictionary\n",
    "                - PROBLEMS:\n",
    "                    - 2 keys that map to same spot in hash table = collision\n",
    "                - SOLUTION:\n",
    "                    - chaining:\n",
    "                        - if multiple keys map to the same spot, we store the items/values in that spot in a list/ linked list\n",
    "                    - worst case is O(n) but in practice it works well because of randomization\n",
    "        - so we end up with a process called hashing with chaining\n",
    "- Why are operations constant in dictionaries?\n",
    "    - ASSUMPTION: Simple uniform hashing\n",
    "        - each key is equally likely to be hashed to any slot of the table, independent of where other keys are hashing.\n",
    "    - ANALYSIS:\n",
    "        - expected length of chain for n keys and m slots n/m (1/m + 1/m + 1/m ...) = load factor\n",
    "        - As long as m = O(n), n/m will be O(1) (constant)\n",
    "        - running time for insert, delete, search (search is hardest)\n",
    "            - running time = O(1 + n/m) which is constant running time for all operations\n",
    "- Hash functions:\n",
    "    - Division Method:\n",
    "        - h(k) = k mod m\n",
    "        - problematic if m and k have common factors\n",
    "        - works a lot of the time but not always\n",
    "    - Multiplication Method:\n",
    "        - h(k) = [(a * k) mod 2^w] >> (w-r)\n",
    "            - a = integer (should be odd)\n",
    "                - in betweeen 2^(r-1) and 2^r\n",
    "            - w = number of bits of words in machine\n",
    "            - r = leftmost part of rightmost w bits\n",
    "        - the shifting ensures the slot we get is random\n",
    "        - you end up with a number between 0 and m-1\n",
    "    - Universal Hashing: (theoretical)\n",
    "        - h(k) = [(ak + b) mod p] mod m\n",
    "            - a and b = random numbers betwee 0 and p-1\n",
    "            - p = prime number > |U| --> only done once per table\n",
    "        - worst-case keys k1 != k2\n",
    "            - probability over a and b colliding\n",
    "                - Pr{h(k1) = h(k2)} = 1/m\n",
    "                    - expected collision is the load factor. this is the ideal situation"
