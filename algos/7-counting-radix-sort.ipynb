    "# 7. Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Lower Bounds for Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear time sorting:\n",
    "    - counting sort\n",
    "    - radix sort\n",
    "- Model of Computation --> Comparison model:\n",
    "    - all input items are black boxes (abstract data types)\n",
    "    - only operations allowed are comparisons (<, <=, >, >=, ==)\n",
    "    - time cost of algorithm in this model = # of comparisons\n",
    "- Decision Tree:\n",
    "    - any comparison algorithm can be viewed as a tree of all possible comparisons and their outcomes and their resulting answer\n",
    "    - not practical but can be useful for algorithmic analysis\n",
    "    - Analogues:\n",
    "        - internal node in DT --> binary decisiion in algorithm (comparison)\n",
    "        - leaf in DT --> found answer in algorithm\n",
    "        - downward root to leaf path in DT --> algorithm execution\n",
    "        - length of the path in DT --> running time of algorithm\n",
    "        - height of tree in DT --> worst case running time\n",
    "- Searching lower bound:\n",
    "    - with the above models, we can prove that the worst case time to find a given item has a lower bound of O(log(n)), not necessarily tight\n",
    "- **Linear-time sorting** --> INTEGER SORTING (assumption)\n",
    "    - assumption is that the n keys we are sorting are integers\n",
    "        - even if not sorting integers, can map things to integers\n",
    "    - assume that integers are in {0, 1, ..., k-1} (k is max) and each integer fits in a word\n",
    "    - can do a lot more than comparisons\n",
    "    - for k not too big, we can sort in O(n) time\n",
    "- **Counting Sort**\n",
    "    - does not making comparisons\n",
    "    - it counts all the items in an array \n",
    "    - Steps:\n",
    "        - [Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKd534EWcdk)\n",
    "        - start with array (new_array) of size k (# of distinct numbers in array)\n",
    "        - traverse given array and write number of occurences at corresponding number index\n",
    "        - in new_array, add each # to the right of it, accumulating the values\n",
    "        - shift all elements in new_array to the right by 1 cell\n",
    "        - now you can output the values\n",
    "    - Complexity --> O(n + k)\n",
    "        - if k = n, then O(n)\n",
    "    - Note:\n",
    "        - counting sort only sorts the integers, but items to be sort could have more data attached to them\n",
    "- **Radix Sort**\n",
    "    - [Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiuSW_mEn7g)\n",
    "    - break each integer into a bunch of columns by imagining each integer as base b (not to be computed)\n",
    "    - d = # of digits = log_b(k) + 1\n",
    "    - sort integers by least significant digit ... sort integers by most significant digit\n",
    "        - each of these sorts are done using _counting sort_ by digit\n",
    "        - this step has O(n+b) complexity\n",
    "    - Total time:\n",
    "        - O((n+b) * d)\n",
    "        - O((n+b) log_b(k)) but now we want to minimize this by setting b = n\n",
    "        - O(n log_n(k)) and if k <= n^c, then the complexity is O(nc)\n",
    "            - this means that if integers are reasonably small, we achieve a linear time sorting algorithm\n",
    "    - Note:\n",
    "        - larger base b --> more space required"
