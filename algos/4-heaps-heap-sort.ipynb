    "\n",
    "- **Priority Queue - Data Structure**\n",
    "    - implements a set S of elements and each of the elements is associated with a key\n",
    "    - motivates understanding of Heap (data structure)\n",
    "    - operations on Priority Queue:\n",
    "        - insert(S, x): insert element x into set S\n",
    "        - max(S): return the element of S with the largest key\n",
    "        - extract-max(S): returns the element of S with the largest key AND removes it from S\n",
    "            - element in the queue was serviced\n",
    "        - increase_key(S, x, k): increase the value of element x's key to the new value k (in the set S)\n",
    "- **Heap - Data Structure**\n",
    "    - implementation of a priority queue\n",
    "    - an array visualized as a nearly complete binary tree\n",
    "        - Ex) [16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1]\n",
    "        - index 1 is the root of the tree --> (note: not 0 based index)\n",
    "        - 2 and 3 are the root's children\n",
    "        - keep going from L -> R where every node has at most 2 children\n",
    "        - <img src = \"screenshots/img_2.png\" width = 300>\n",
    "    - Heap as a tree:\n",
    "        - root of tree: first element (i = 1)\n",
    "        - parent(i) = i/2\n",
    "        - left(i) = 2i (index of left child)\n",
    "        - right(i) = 2i + 1 (index of right child)\n",
    "        - Height of binary heap is O(log(n))\n",
    "    - Max-Heap property:\n",
    "        - key of a node is >= the keys of its children\n",
    "    - Min-Heap property:\n",
    "        - key of a node is <= the keys of its children\n",
    "    - On a Max-Heap, the max(...) operation is performed trivially \n",
    "    - We could conduct sorting on a heap by continually running extract-max(...) and we would get a list of keys in decreasing order.\n",
    "        - We would want to maintain Max-Heap property as we do this.\n",
    "    - Question to consider: How do we build a Max-Heap from an unsorted array?\n",
    "    - _HEAP OPERATIONS/ METHODS_\n",
    "        - heap_size(A): returns the number of elements in heap\n",
    "        - build_max_heap(array): produces a max-heap from an arbitrary/ unordered array\n",
    "            - build_max_heap(A): --> pseudocode\n",
    "                - for i = n/2 down to 1: --> n/2 because it is the level above the leaves\n",
    "                - do max_heapify(A, i)\n",
    "            - **COMPLEXITY**: O(nlog(n)) worst case but IT IS O(n) complexity\n",
    "                - 1. Observe that max_heapify takes O(1) fr nodes that are one level above leaves and in general O(l) time for nodes that are l levels above the leaves.\n",
    "                - 2. there are n/4 (+/- 1) with level 1, n/8 with level 2, ... and 1 node at the log(n) level (root node)\n",
    "                    - there's a decrease in nodes the more work the algorithm needs to do\n",
    "                - 3. Total amount of work in the for loop can be summed as:\n",
    "                    - n/4(1 x c) + n/8(2 x c) + n/16(3 x c + ... 1 * (log(n) * c)\n",
    "                    - set n/4 = 2^k (in order to write the following)\n",
    "                    - <img src = \"screenshots/img_3.png\" width = 400>\n",
    "                    - the expression in the brackets converges to around 2 or 3 which ends up asymptotically cancelling with the 1/4 and c is just a constant so we end up with O(n)\n",
    "        - max_heapify(A, i): correct a single violation of the heap property in a subtree's root.\n",
    "            - A = array, i = index\n",
    "            - takes in a non max-heap by a single violation and it will fix that\n",
    "            - needs to be able to be done recursively at different levels in order to build a max-heap\n",
    "            - max_heapify(A, i): --> psuedocode\n",
    "                - l = left(i)\n",
    "                - r = right(i)\n",

    "            - KEY ASSUMPTION:\n",
    "                - Assume that the trees rooted at left(i) and right(i) are max-heaps. If this is violated, we can't do anything\n",
    "                - leaves of the tree are by definition max-heaps\n",
    "             - **COMPLEXITY**: _O(log(n))_\n",
    "                 - nearly complete binary tree, we're moving level by level to try and correct violation\n",
    "                 - IT IS NOT O(n) because there's only 1 violation to correct upon a single call of max-heapify\n",
